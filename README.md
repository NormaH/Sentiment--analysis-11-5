# Sentiment--analysis-11-5
Sentiment analysis from a given dataset (it should be read as text, typically using the tab as delimiter). YOu may use files available at the University of California Irvine datasets (sentiment_Labelled_Sentences) to test it. 
The Naive Bayes model is used in this case (due to timing constraints of having a deliverable working)  for prediction but other models may be used to optimize accuracy,  recall and score. In this case Naive Bayes yielded 73% accuracy; considering there were only 800 training records, it is not a bad choice. As the the number of records increases the accuracy is expected to improve.   
Will be posting later a comparitive model.
