Sentiment analysis from a dataset
A text file (taking tabs as delimiter as text content will likely contain commas ) with sentiment content (usually where a record is a line) is processed through the model.  The present model used Naive Bayes prediction algorithm but other algorith (such as decision trees) may be used.  For purpose of timing delivery of a model working no other models were tested. 

You may find text content files at the University of Irvine California datasets to test the model, and to identify if the file you intent to submit to the model may not face formatting needs before processing. Here ( https://www.dropbox.com/s/41vk97uqlza3wec/NLP-sentiment-analysis-executable%20code%20show%201000th%20record-Amazon%20review%20dataset.GIF?dl=0  )   you may find screen picture of the code running and some of the outputs including the confusion matrix, variable explorer and the last record in the file called in.
